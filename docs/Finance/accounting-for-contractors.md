## Accounting guidelines for team members who sign contract with Multilogin as companies



This document is part of the onboarding package and contains info on the main accounting operations done during the process along with the guidelines on the following monthly invoicing to Multilogin expected from the contractors to make the cooperation smooth, transparent and clear.



### Laptop purchase

When joining Multilogin every new team member should have a new laptop ordered and delivered before the first day at the company. Upon the end of the contract with ML/equipment ware off the laptop should be returned to the company on the basis of Delivery-Acceptance Act (DAA) which will be signed when the equipment is bought.

At the moment there are two options available:

- for the new joiner to order the laptop him/herself on behalf of Multilogin

- to ask for a credit from Multilogin


#### Ordering laptop by the contractor themselves

1. Once the contract is signed by both parties and the model of the laptop is confirmed, the new joiner may proceed with laptop purchase.
2. The (DAA) is to be signed between Multilogin and the contractor to certify that the laptop becomes a possession of Multilogin, stays in use of the contractor and will be returned to ML at the end of the contract/equipment ware off. This document is also needed to show that Multilogin authorised the contractor to make a purchase on their behalf and contractor's eligibility for reimbursement.
3. The purchase should be made from person's private account (not from the account of the company they represent). Thus, the purchase shall be made by the person as individual and not by a legal entity they represent.
4. The laptop should be purchased on Multilogin name (please check the invoice details below in this article).
5. On the first day of new joiner's onboarding he/she will be provided with access to our expense tracking system together with instructions on how to use it (link below). He/she will need to submit an equipment purchase expense report during their first week at Multilogin adding the receipts/invoices from the seller, as we will need it for accounting purposes.
6. The reimbursement is provided to the new joiner together with the first salary.

#### Getting a credit from Multiogn

1. Once the contract is signed by both parties and the model of the laptop is confirmed, the new joiner may ask for a credit from ML for laptop purchase purposes.

2. The Delivery-Acceptance Act (DAA) is to be signed between Multilogin and the contractor to certify that the laptop becomes a possession of Multilogin, stays in use of contractor and will be returned to ML upon the end of the contract/equipment ware off. This document is also needed to show that Multilogin authorised the contractor to make a purchase on their behalf and the amount of credit issued to the contractor.

3. The credit is transferred to the contractor's personal checking account.

4. On the first day of the new joiner's onboarding he/she will be provided with access to our expense tracking system together with instructions on how to use it. He/she will need to submit an equipment purchase expense report during their first week at Multilogin adding seller receipts/invoices as we will need them for the accounting purposes.

   NB! Please note that the first salary amount might be adjusted taking in consideration the credit transfer. For eg: the advance amount was 2900 eur transferred on 11th of November, when according to the invoice enclosed the actual price of the laptop was 2863 eur. The contractor joined ML on Nov, 15. In this case 37 eur will be deducted from the total November salary amount.

#### Invoice details

Please make sure that the following info appears on the invoice:

**Valid ML credentials:**

```
Multilogin Software OÜ
Registration number: 12660871
VAT number: EE101775690
Address: Supluse pst 1 - 201A, Tallinn, Harju maakond, 11911, ESTONIA
```

Some services will not accept "OÜ" symbol, use "OU" or "Ltd" instead.

**Your company valid credentials:**

- full company name including legal form
- registry number
- company address
- VAT number

- description - what the invoice is for (equipment purchase/business trip/services etc.)
- total amount
- date
- payment details



#### First month at ML salary calculation principle

Please note that the first month salary will be adjusted according to the days worked in the company. For eg., if the contractor is joining ML on Nov, 8th they will not be paid the whole amount stated in the contract, but rather will get payment for the days worked in the company.

The calculations will be made according to the following principle:

There are total of 22 work days in November. The contractor started working in ML eg. on 8th of Nov. Thus spent 17 days working for ML.

Monthly salary amount is eg. 4000 eur. 4000/22=182 eur - daily salary.

17x182=3094 will be the amount earned in 17 days.



#### Salary invoices

Contractors should prepare invoices for the service they provide to ML based on what they'll get paid. Salary invoices should be issued and uploaded to Dext expense tracker by **25th of each month**.

##### How to upload a salary invoice to Dext

When you're uploading salary invoices, please don't create an expense report. Simply add the document to 'Costs' field and choose "Salaries and compensations" category from the drop-down menu.

*NB! Please keep salary and equipment/service purchase invoices separate for the ease of expense tracking. To put it a few words, all you need to remember is the following:*

- Salary invoices - no expense report needed.
- Equipment/employee training/sports compensations/business trips etc. (basically all the expenses made by you that you'd like to get compensated), please merge proof of purchase from the seller together with the same amount invoice issued on behalf of your company and create an expense report.



#### Multilogin company cards

A company Revolut card can be issued for the EU residents for the ease of accounting and avoiding reimbursement waiting time. Feel free to ask Business Operations Specialist to order a company card for you. The details on how to use Revolut cards can be found below.



#### No personal account transfers

No transfers to contractor's personal accounts are possible (except the first laptop purchase reimbursement). The reason for that is the fact that the upon termination of the contract the laptop will need to be returned to Multilogin and it is easier to have it documented as Multilogin's property straight away. The rest of the equipment that costs less than 500 eur would stay in the possession of the contractor, thus the contractor can make a purchase straight on their company name.



#### Always check with your accountant

Reimbursement amounts transferred by Multilogin to contractor's company account in some cases can be treated as income by their local Tax department and may be a subject to tax. In order to find the best course of action we recommend to consult with the local accountant. It is contractor's responsibility to look for best possible solutions in handling their company's internal accounting.
