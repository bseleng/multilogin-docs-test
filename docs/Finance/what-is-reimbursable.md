## What is reimbursable in ML

Below you can see the list of all the things that Multilogin team members can get reimbursements for.

On the bottom of the page you'll find all the useful links connected to the topic of expense reimbursement.

In case something remains unclear, please turn to Operations Specialist for advice.

| Expense Category         | Policy                                                       |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Equipment**            | All the equipment necessary for great professional performance and execution of daily tasks is eligible for reimbursement (headphones, monitor, desk, chair, mouse, keyboard etc). The laptop is provided to every team member once they start working in ML. The rest of the equipment can be ordered by team member themselves. The return upon the end of the contract policy is as follows: everything that costs over 500 eur should be bought out from Multilogin (apart from the laptop, that should be returned) based on the average price for the item in same condition (e-bay can be checked for that). The rest of the equipment may remain in team member's possession. When placing an order, please consider the price vs. quality indicators. For eg. a 1500 eur chair would definitely be an overkill. However, buying a 30 eur headset just to try to save company money could lead to product malfunction within the next few month due to it's low quality, and the need of paying for a replacement. Follow the common sense principle, and things will be fine:). Please keep in mind that the company is willing to reimburse the equipment used for work purposes and not design & d√©cor stuff like candles, area rugs, decorative pillows etc. |
| **Business trips**       | Eg. a team gathering takes place in Tallinn with the purpose of working on a specific goal and for team members to know each other better. All airfares, local transportation and accommodation is compensated by Multilogin. Business trips must be confirmed with the team lead.  Expenses for significant others or family members are not covered. NB! Please keep in mind the golden rule followed in Multilogin: act in the best interests of the company. That relates to choosing hotels, taking a tram instead of taxi (when possible and reasonable), flying economy instead of business class etc. No one says that you're 'not allowed' to fly 1st class, it may be even preferable for eg. when you're having a late flight and presenting ML on the conference next day, but all the expenses should be reasonable. |
| **Co Working Space**     | Reimbursable up to 250 eur per month. All the contracts need to be under team member's name. |
| **Employee training**    | Costs associated with professional training and development (books, classes, online courses, mentorship etc) are reimbursable. Reimbursements are done based on the expense reports filed in Dext. For courses that cost over 500 eur a team lead approval is needed. |
| **Conferences**          | Conferences with educational/promotional purposes are eligible for reimbursement (conference fees, transportation, accommodation). All the conference trips need to be approved by your team lead. |
| **Celebrations**         | Flowers for birthdays, gifts for birth of a child, wedding are given to ML team members. |
| **Sports compensations** | 100 eur/quarter is allocated to every team member who is using sports services/activities after uploading invoices/receipts. Invoices should be uploaded in Dext in the form of expense report by the end of every quarter. In case of a 6-month/annual membership purchase, one invoice can be uploaded to Dext, reimbursement up to 100 eur will be provided every quarter. |
| **Laptops**              | All team members are provided with a laptop before their 1st day at Multilogin. If a laptop was purchased by the team member themselves, 100% of it's cost is reimbursable. A laptop can be exchanged for a new one due to it's wear off/malfunction. If a team member needs a replacement laptop due to damage/war off, they must confirm it with their team lead first. |
| **Parties and snacks**   | Every once in a while, there's a pizza-pasta-Chinese party at Multilogin. Costs are covered on the basis of expense report. Expenses for family members will not be covered. |
| **Postage/Shipping**     | Postage/shipping/custom charges related to the sending and or receiving of work documentation, or special packages can be reimbursed. |
| **Software**             | All work related software subscriptions should be purchased on Multilogin name and by using company cards (Revolut or bank). Only in case the company card is not available in your region, you can submit an expense report and ask for reimbursement. |
