These following two paragraphs should be remembered by each Multilogin team member.

### Purpose (of the product)

Help ordinary people achieve financial independence by launching a business online.

### Mission (of the product)

We make a software tool that helps our users quickly launch, manage and scale online businesses that depend on managing multiple online accounts or unregistered browsing identities. We achieve it by providing them with virtual browser profiles that replace virtual machines and hardware computers. With an unlimited number of virtual browser profiles at their disposal users can conveniently use multiple online profiles or unregistered digital identities.

### Examples for better understanding

#### Case 1

An affiliate team rents Facebook accounts from people to launch advertising campaigns in them.

How Multilogin helps:

- Users create a browser profile that looks similar to the computer of a person who a Facebook account was rented from. Therefore, Facebook does not present security checks to the team.
- Multiple people can work on the same browser account without triggering security checks. Team's work does not interfere with account owner's operations.
- The team can manage hundreds of rented accounts from a single control panel.
- At different stages of the process team's administrator may provide and revoke access to the account to different team members
- By launching campaigns in different accounts, the team diversifies risk. Having one account restricted from running advertising campaigns does not lead to all campaigns being halted.

#### Case 2

An e-commerce vendor manages an online shop.

How Multilogin helps:

- An e-commerce vendor can have multiple online shops on a big e-commerce platform like Amazon or eBay. While officially it's not allowed, unofficially these platforms only ban severe abuse as having more shops on the platform actually benefits their end-customers.
- By having each shop in separate browser profiles that are not linked to each other, a vendor diversifies risks. If one store gets restricted other will keep functioning.
- Having multiple shops allows making them more specialized which improves shop's ranking in search results, recommendation systems etc.
- A vendor can safely grant access to assistants to manage shops while controlling their access and not having to reveal a shop account's password.

#### Case 3:

Not everyone wants to go through the trouble of creating their own advertising cabinets or e-commerce accounts. An account vendor pre-creates accounts on popular platforms and later sells them.

How Multilogin helps:

- Not everyone wants to go through the trouble of creating their own advertising cabinets or e-commerce accounts. An account vendor may pre-create accounts and sell them. With Multilogin when account is accessed by a new owner there's no change in device signature, therefore security checks are not triggered.
- Multilogin helps to keep things organized when creating and transferring to new owners thousands of accounts.

#### Case 4:

IDOs are a new way to distribute tokens in a distributed blockchain-based project. People participate in IDOs to buy an allocation of tokens issued by a project.

How Multilogin helps:

- Token sale participant may sign up for the sale multiple times by using several browser profiles with different proxies assigned to them. Therefore, they get higher chances to be approved to buy a portion of tokens.

#### Case 5:

Collecting ad intelligence from social networks inaccessible without an account. An automation engineer may want to scrape ads ran on a social network and reverse engineer their targeting. This is done by recording ads show to accounts with different properties (male/female, student/working, age 20-30/age 31-40 etc) and analyzing similarities between accounts that were shown the same ad. Later this data can be sold as intelligence.

How Multilogin helps:

- With Multilogin an automation engineer can access social network using distinct non-linked browsing identities which makes possible creation of thousands accounts.
- Multilogin helps controlling browser profile across a network of VPS service. An engineer can program when to launch browser profile, where to navigate in a browser, what operations to perform, what data to save.
- Multilogin provides improved browser automation tools (Selenium Hardened, Puppeteer) which unlike their vanilla originals do not reveal that a browser instance was automated
