**Owning it** means actually caring and embracing responsibility. Imagine owning a house. Would you do a low quality repair in your house? Would you let trash lay in front of your house? Would you wait someone to take action instead of you if a water pipe was leaking? Would you care about your house being properly connected to city communications and operable at all times? In a work setting, we care about and embrace responsibility for our area of work and everything surrounding it (think what would happen with your house if a city was devastated)

**Collaborate proactively** means initiating teamwork without being explicitly asked or required by procedures. Teamwork starts every time you see an opportunity to help someone improve their work, resolve existing issues, or help with an additional context to their work.

**Go above and beyond** means doing more than required, making an extra effort to overcome expectations. This is important in internal work when another team or team member is your customer. It is *especially* important when working with customers who pay the company.

**Make decisions autonomously** means assuming responsibility for decisions and making them without involving team leads in every decision. This doesn't mean skipping feedback collection, not at all. The more important a decision is, the more feedback you have to collect from relevant people. However, in the end decisions should be made by you. Don't expect someone make them instead.

**Be honest** means being realistic and open about own work results, strengths, weaknesses, mistakes. Being honest means providing direct honest feedback to colleagues and accepting theirs. Being honest means accepting reality and dealing with it in an adult way.

**Question everything** means having an inquiring mind and challening assumptions. As an organization grows bigger, it acquires beliefs that haven't necessarily been validated in the first place or became invalid in a changed environment. We continuously reassess our beliefs and find factual evidence to support or disprove them.

**Get a wider context** means learning about matters outside of your immediate area and applying this knowledge to improve your work. We typically work with systems encapsulated in larger systems. The more systems below and above one knows, the better they can understand their part.

**Add some fun** doesn't mean becoming a clown :) We are dedicated to serious work and success but we are also humans who like to smile. Adding fun means a tiny effort to make people you work with smile and enjoy their day.
