## Multilogin Strategy (Last updated 08. May. 2022) ##
A new user coming to the space gets exposed to a variety of anti-detection browsers, Multilogin being one of them. There’s no clear answer why Multilogin is better than any or all of them. Besides, Multilogin is typically the most expensive of all. 

The easiest way for a user to choose between multiple offerings is to find which one is the most suited to their job and costs the least. This pushes developers of all solutions into tailoring for several segments and use cases. 

As the market leader serving a wide array of segments, Multilogin cannot afford to focus on just one segment at the cost of dropping the rest. At the same time, our attention, resources, and organization quality are insufficient to deeply specialize the product for multiple market segments at once. 

**The best strategy to address this challenge would be to build a browser management platform with maximum flexibility and customizability for automating mundane tasks while outsourcing segment-specific customization development to an external developer community.** 

It can be brought to light by de-prioritizing niche-specific features with high capital investment and maintenance costs. Instead, we should prioritize everything that improves our load handling capacity, 24/7 stability of service, customizability, and other flexibility in ways of using. 

Our customer relationships and support should focus on automation developers and users of automation tools.

We should also review our pricing model to prioritize monetization of users that utilize automation. Pricing should be built around value points relevant to both small- and large-scale users of automation but might be less relevant or irrelevant to manual users. 

## Our USP

We provide a software solution to quickly launch and scale online businesses in affiliate, e-commerce, SMM, web scraping, crypto, and similar industries where people conduct manual or semi-automated work through multiple browsing instances. We automate the process of creating new browser instances that have distinct digital signatures and we also let users automate actions in these browser profiles.

Multilogin is different from competitiors because it's flexible and scientific. We remove the guessing game from the process of setting up a browser profile. Users are offered the best working setup in the beginning and an instruction how to find a working setup if the default doesn't work.

## Multilogin is better than competition because ##
+ We are the only company who provides **flexible and scientific technology** to avoid multiple account detection based on browser fingerprinting
+ We deliver frequent core updates for two most popular browsers - Chrome and Firefox branded as Mimic and Stealthfox within the application. Using a recent version of the core is essential to avoid account restrictions.
+ We make no compromises in security. Your data never leaves your computer unencrypted. All data synchronization between accounts and devices is End-2-End encrypted.

## Mission-to-Metrics and other Key metrics 

+ Our Mission-to-Metrics is the number of customers in the Key Customers group that started using at least 12 browser profiles.
+ Our goal is to achieve 4MM euros MRR by the end of 2024
+ We aim to retain 50% profit margin in the long-term (2-3+ years)
+ We do not care about EV (enterprise valuation)
+ Our Sandbox markets: Affiliate teams in US, Russia, China, Brazil; E-commerce specialists in US, Vietnam, China
+ Our Key Customers: For the time being, we equate Key Customers to the Sandbox markets until further notice.
